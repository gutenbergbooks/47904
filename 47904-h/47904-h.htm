<h3 class="no-break"><b>HOUSE OF JACQUES C&OElig;UR: BOURGES.</b></h3>




<p class="p2">The house of Jacques C&oelig;ur at Bourges
is, to architect and historian alike,
one of the most interesting monuments
which have survived from the Middle
Ages,&mdash;interesting to the architect not
only for its intrinsic beauty, but from the
fact that it is the most complete and important
specimen which remains of all the civil
buildings in France of the Gothic period,
and which, because of the brief time occupied
in its construction, exhibits the style
of the fifteenth century in unusual purity,
and interesting to the historian from its
connection with Jacques C&oelig;ur, one of the
most picturesque and remarkable figures
in French history. That Jacques C&oelig;ur
was the son of a wealthy fur merchant of
Bourges, and that he was born in 1395, are
the only facts of importance in his eventful
career that are known, until he first makes
his appearance on the historical stage, under
rather disadvantageous circumstances, in
1420. The Dauphin of France, driven
across the Loire by the English and their
Burgundian allies, had made Bourges the
seat of his government, and had appointed
a certain Ravant-le-Danois master of the
Bourges mint,&mdash;a post of some importance.
Ravant-le-Danois had taken into partnership
(for at this time the coining of public
moneys was farmed out to private enterprise)
Jacques C&oelig;ur, and the two, finding
that the profits of the business were not so
large as they had expected, presently resorted
to illegitimate methods of increasing
them; and C&oelig;ur appears to have been
active in the process of issuing money
which was considerably under the standard
weight. The fraud was discovered; but
the kings of France themselves had been
too often guilty of tampering with the coin
of the realm for the offence to carry with
it any deep disgrace; and, perhaps considering
the state of the royal treasury, justice
considered itself satisfied with a fine equal to
about $7500. Thereafter, however, Jacques
C&oelig;ur appears to have cast about for a more
honorable channel into which to direct his
energy. Enterprising, keen-eyed, determined
by some means or other to make his
fortune, he naturally turned his face eastward.
The trade between Europe and the
Levant had never been more active than
it was in the early part of the fifteenth
century, in spite of the ecclesiastical restrictions
laid upon it. For the Church,
still dreaming of new crusades and a Christian
rule in the Holy Land, censured all
peaceful dealings with the infidel. But the
demand for Eastern luxuries&mdash;silks, gems,
perfumes and spices&mdash;was immense, and
the trade too lucrative to be renounced;
and so Rome satisfied her conscience by
allowing the traffic to be carried on by certain
persons within certain well-defined
limits, and was handsomely paid for the
concession. The merchants of Montpellier
in France had obtained a license from the
pope to send one ship yearly to Eastern
ports, and to their fraternity Jacques C&oelig;ur
joined himself in 1432. He had chosen a
propitious moment to begin his operations.
France was beginning to recover from the
prostrate condition in which the civil war
had left her, and C&oelig;ur's ventures prospered
marvellously. Before long he is the recorded
owner of seven vessels, and employer
of no less than three hundred agents who
represented him in all the chief commercial
centres in France and abroad. His ships
sailed to the furthest harbors of the Levant,
and his relations with the sultan assumed political
importance. A contemporary chronicler
describes him as "a second Jason, with
Cairo for his Colchis strand."</p>

<p>A merchant of such wealth and importance
could hardly be overlooked by Charles
VII., who had a talent for putting the right
man in the right place; and when in 1436
Paris at last consented to admit the king,
he re-established an Hôtel des Monnaies in
the capital, and gave the direction of it to
the man who had managed his own monetary
affairs with such striking results. It
was in connection with this office that
C&oelig;ur rendered his country his most important
and permanent service.</p>

<p>France was flooded with debased coin,
English, Burgundian and French: indeed
so little could the merchants depend upon
the nominal value of the pieces which
passed through their hands that they stipulated
with each other for payment by
weight instead of in the usual legal tender.
Jacques C&oelig;ur recognized the disastrous
effects of this system; and as soon as he
became master of the Paris mint undertook
to reform it. Money suspected
of being under weight was arbitrarily
seized, wherever it was
found, and a new gold and silver
coinage of full value was
struck. "The new treasurer,"
says a chronicler, "believed
that the way for the king to
grow rich, as for other people,
was to pay his debts."</p>

<p>In 1440 so high did Jacques
C&oelig;ur stand in royal favor that
he was made a member of the
King's Council, granted letters
of nobility and created keeper
of the privy-purse, a post which
carried with it many valuable
privileges connected with the
court, and by which he profited
to the fullest extent. He had
the right of selling merchandise
in the precincts of the
royal residence to the nobles
and courtiers, and to loan
money to the whole court. There exist
among the treasurer's papers of the time
notes to the effect that the queen borrowed
a sum equivalent to $700 from him
and pledged a pearl for its repayment, and
that the king's youngest daughter Madame
Aragonde borrowed $650 "<i>pour avoir une
robe</i>."</p>

<p>His talents found recognition outside of
the domain of finance. He served on royal
commissions and went on important embassies.
On one of these, his entry into
Rome was so magnificent that the spectators
declared "it was sixty years since they
had seen the like, but that the expense of
it was outrageous."</p>

<p>All this time his wealth had continued
to increase. Poets celebrated it in their
verses; his rivals watched it with bitter
envy. Exaggerated stories of his lavish
expenditure became current. It was reported
that the commonest utensils of his
house were of silver, that even his horses
were shod with it. From impoverished
nobles, who were his debtors, he commenced
to buy great estates all over France. It was
at this time, in 1443, that he began to build
his unrivalled house in Bourges, his native
town, although he already possessed mansions
at Marseilles, Montpellier, Beaucaire,
Lyons, Tours, Béziers and Paris.</p>

<p>When in 1449 the four years' truce with
England was broken, the French threw
themselves vigorously anew into the war,
and Charles set himself with unusual
energy to efface the last traces of his country's
long humiliation. The campaign was
actively planned, but there was no money
in the royal treasury. The king appealed
to the only man in France able to meet the
urgent necessities of the case, the merchant
Jacques C&oelig;ur. He was walking
alone with the king when Charles broached
the subject and asked him to advance the
money for the Norman enterprise. "All
that I have, sire, is yours," was the answer;
and Charles had no further anxiety about
the payment of his troops. The nominal
loan, but virtual gift, of Jacques C&oelig;ur to
the crown was an amount equivalent to
$2,500,000 in our money.</p>

<p>After a series of brilliant victories Charles
at length triumphed, and the English
empire in France ended. The part the
treasurer had taken was not forgotten.
In the triumphal entry into Rouen he rode,
magnificent in crimson velvet and fur,
beside Lieutenant-General Dunois, the
hero of the day. Apparently he was in
the heyday of his prosperity, and outwardly
all continued to go well with him; but his
downfall was pending. The whole court
owed him money, and each debtor was a
foe in ambush; the king, who invariably
grew weary of those who were for long
about him, was secretly not unwilling to
sacrifice this man who had held so chief a
part in his affairs for fifteen years, and
C&oelig;ur had made two bitter enemies, high
in court favor,&mdash;the Comte de Dammartin
and Otto Castellani, an Italian, the latter
of whom coveted the treasurer's office for
himself. The blow fell at last, and with
dramatic abruptness. In 1451 Jacques C&oelig;ur
was arrested on the trumped-up charge of
having poisoned the king's mistress, Agnes
Sorel, who had died eighteen months
before, and one of whose executors he
had been.</p>

<p>A special commission was appointed to
try the case, and the first two names on the
list of his judges were those of the Comte
de Dammartin, president, and Otto Castellani!
Before the trial began the prisoner's
property was declared forfeit to the crown,
and a first charge of $1,250,000 was levied
upon it for the expenses of the war in
Guienne. Jacques C&oelig;ur's generosity had
redeemed one province; a second was to
be recovered by his ruin.</p>

<p>The accusation of poisoning was so obviously
groundless that it was at once abandoned;
but half a dozen other charges were
quickly formulated against him, amongst
them those of having exported French
money to the East; of having sold arms to
the infidel; of having administered the
king's affairs fraudulently and tyranically
in Languedoc, and of having issued light
money from the mint.</p>

<p>C&oelig;ur defended himself bravely, but he
might have spared himself the trouble.
His judges had already agreed upon a verdict.
He was dragged from one prison to
another, continually protesting his innocence,
continually appealing to the Church
for protection; till at last in 1453 he was
brought into the torture chamber of the
Castle of Tours and threatened with the
rack. Weary and weak from twenty months
of suspense and confinement, his heart
failed him, and he agreed to admit all the
charges against him except that of having
poisoned Agnes Sorel.</p>

<p>In consideration of the pope's intercession
and of C&oelig;ur's former services his life
was spared; but he was condemned to pay
the king $1,250,000 as restitution money, and
$2,500,000 as a fine, and to be banished forever
from the kingdom. On being notified
of the decree, Jacques replied that he could
not possibly raise the sums demanded. He
himself owed money which he had borrowed
for the king's affairs, and his goods were
not worth so much. He was accordingly
thrown again into prison, and the procurer-general
proceeded to sell, by public auction,
all the property of the prisoner which, after
diligent search, he could find throughout
the kingdom, including the house at
Bourges.</p>

<p>Two years passed, and the sentence of
banishment was not yet executed, perhaps
because the fines were not yet paid. At the
end of that time C&oelig;ur, by the help of one
of his former clerks, contrived to escape
from prison, and fled to Rome.</p>

<p>The end of his life is almost as obscure
as the beginning. It is clear however, that,
though now a man of over sixty, whose last
five years had been years of intense suffering,
C&oelig;ur was recognized by the pope,
Calixtus III., as a man of ability and spirit.
Constantinople had fallen, and the pope
was anxious to undertake a new crusade.
But the days of crusades were over; and
his envoys pleaded and reasoned with the
sovereigns of Christendom in vain. At
length, in despair, the pope fitted out sixteen
galleys himself, and in 1456 sent them
to succor the Christian colonies in the
Archipelago. The patriarch of Aquileia
was the nominal
leader, but an actual
leader was required,
and Calixtus offered
the secondary command
to none other
than the French
exile, Jacques C&oelig;ur.
C&oelig;ur accepted the
post; but his new
career was a very
short one.</p>

<p>The expedition
sailed first to Rhodes
and thence to Chios,
and here C&oelig;ur fell
ill as the result of a
wound received in
some skirmish on
the way. He died
on the 25th of
November and was
buried in the Franciscan
church on the
island, forgiving his
enemies and his king
with his last breath.</p>

<p>As has been said,
Jacques C&oelig;ur's most
princely residence,
that at Bourges, was
begun in 1443, when
he was at the height
of his prosperity,
and was nearly completed
when in 1451
his downfall came.
In spite of changes
in the arrangement
of the interior, in
spite of a clumsy
addition in the Renaissance
style on
the right of the
courtyard, and in
spite of some blunders
in the restoration,
which was undertaken by the government
in 1858, the building has escaped
any grave mutilation, and may be taken as
a type of the princely residence of its
century.</p>

<p>Owing to the loss of C&oelig;ur's personal
papers in the confusion incident to his trial,
the name of his architect is unknown.
From the general style and especially on
account of certain details of ornamentation
it is possible that he
was Jean Gaussel,
the architect who
built the façade of
Saint Germain
l'Auxerrois at Paris;
but this is merely a
surmise.</p>

<p>As a site for this
house C&oelig;ur had
bought a domain,
known as the <i>Fief
de la Chaussée</i>,
which bordered
upon the ancient
rampart of Bourges,
and included two of
the original towers
of that rampart.
These two towers he
restored and heightened,
and they
served as a beginning
for the new
construction and
were incorporated
with it. The general
plan of the
whole is an irregular
pentagon&mdash;a
central court surrounded
by unsymmetrical
groups of
buildings, according
to the disposition of
almost all mediæval
civil and military
buildings. It is
clear that the architect
sacrificed every
consideration of
symmetry to the
exigencies of usefulness
and convenience;
but the
resulting irregularity
is quite in
harmony with the Gothic style, and conduces
not a little to the picturesqueness of
the whole.</p>

<p>The façade of the house (<a href="#LI">Plate <span class="smcap">LI.</span></a>) faces
a small square in which stands a modern
statue of Jacques C&oelig;ur. The main feature
of this façade is a central pavilion (<a href="#LII">Plate
<span class="smcap">LII.</span></a>) which contains the main portal of
the house comprising two entrances, the
larger for horsemen and guests, the smaller
for tradesmen and servants. Above the
portal is a niche sheltered by a carved
canopy, wherein an equestrian statue of
Charles VII. originally stood. The niche
is flanked by two false windows, and out of
each leans a stone figure, one representing
a man-servant, the other a maid-servant,
both dressed in the costumes of the time,
who peer out into the street as if to watch
for the return of their lord. On the left of
the pavilion rises a beautifully elaborated
prism-shaped tower, within which winds a
spiral staircase leading to a chapel. This
chapel occupies nearly the whole of the
first story of the front, and a great window
that lights it opens above the entrance.</p>

<p>The coat of arms of Jacques C&oelig;ur&mdash;three
black cockle-shells and three crimson hearts,
the latter in punning allusion to his name,
with his motto "<i>A vaillans c&oelig;urs rien
impossible</i>," the word "<i>c&oelig;urs</i>" being represented
by two hearts&mdash;is frequently
repeated in the carvings of the façade. Indeed
everywhere throughout the building
we find these emblems,&mdash;in the windows,
in all the carvings, above the mantlepieces,
even on the tiles of the roof, and the bell of
the chapel; and the nail-heads of the door-fastenings
are shaped like hearts.</p>

<p>The main entrance leads directly into
the great courtyard, around which the various
constructions which make up the whole
are irregularly grouped. The design of
the pavilion of the façade is repeated on
the inner side, but in place of the statue
of the king the niche was originally occupied
by a statue of Jacques C&oelig;ur. To the
left of the portal, under an arcade, is the
entrance to the spiral stairway (<a href="#LIII">Plate <span class="smcap">LIII.</span></a>)
which winds within the tower to the chapel.
The tympana above the three openings to
this stairway are carved in relief with rude
but vigorous figures, the designs being
appropriate to their situation. On the tympanum
most plainly shown in our illustration,
for example, the carving depicts three
acolytes preparing an altar for service.
Throughout the house the carvings are,
after the same fashion, made characteristic
of the rooms or entrances which they adorn:
the carvings over the kitchen staircase represent
culinary operations,&mdash;a roast hanging
above the fire, a boy turning the spit,
a woman washing plates, a cook grinding
spices,&mdash;that leading to the dining-room
is ornamented with fruit-trees, and so
forth.</p>


<p>The principal side of the court, architecturally
considered, is opposite the main
entrance (<a href="#LV">Plate <span class="smcap">LV.</span></a>). The chief feature
of this side is a great octagonal tower
which contains the stairway leading to a
dining-hall situated on the first floor and
corresponding in position to the chapel in
the front wing. The north and west sides
of the courtyard are surrounded, on the
ground floor, by cloisters (<a href="#LIV">Plate <span class="smcap">LIV.</span></a>)
above which were the living-rooms and
household offices.</p>

<p>The rear view of the building (<a href="#LVIII">Plate
<span class="smcap">LVIII.</span></a>) shows that part of the construction
which was based upon the ancient rampart
of the city. The two large towers are those
before referred to, which were still standing
as part of the rampart when the building
of the house was begun. One was
entirely reconstructed by C&oelig;ur, with the
exception of the first story, which is of old
Roman work as the layers of brick and
masonry indicate; the other received only
its crown and a new interior construction,
and like the first, was flanked by a tower
destined to serve as a cage for the stairway.</p>

<p>The only room of architectural interest
in the interior, which has been largely remodelled
to serve the various public uses
to which the building has since been put,
is the chapel (<a href="#LVI">Plates <span class="smcap">LVI.</span></a> and <a href="#LVII"><span class="smcap">LVII.</span></a>).
Here the side walls have suffered from too
ardent restoration; but the splendid painted
ceiling is intact. It is divided by ribs, the
bosses of which are decorated with the
arms of Jacques C&oelig;ur and those of his wife,
into twelve triangles, four large and eight
small ones; and within these triangles, relieved
against a background of gold-starred
blue, angels bearing ribbons inscribed with
scriptural texts are painted. The breadth
and beauty of the design, the sobriety and
harmony of the color-scheme and the excellence
of execution gives this ceiling first
importance as a document in the history of
French decorative painting.</p>

<p>Taken as a whole this house, though
rivalled by the Hôtel de Cluny at Paris
and the Palais de l'Échiquier at Rouen,
ranks as the most splendid civil construction
antedating the Renaissance which remains
in France. Its history is known
without interruption from the beginning.
Five years after its confiscation it was restored
to C&oelig;ur's descendants. In 1501 it
was sold by them, passing through several
hands, until in 1682 it became the property
of the city of Bourges and was made to
serve as the Hôtel de Ville. In 1858 it was
ceded to the State, and is now used as a
Palais de Justice.</p>

<p class="p2">Examples of decorative carving in
wood dating prior to the Middle
Ages are extremely rare. Some
sculptured figures of saints, and other
fragments of a more solid sort, have survived,
but the more delicate ornamental
work has disappeared. Indeed most of
the ornamental wood-carvings which have
come down to us even from the Middle
Ages belong almost exclusively to the
end of that period, when, especially in
Germany, the art attained unrivalled productiveness
and excellence.</p>

<p>During the late fifteenth and early sixteenth
centuries, the skill in technical
workmanship was unsurpassed. By this
time, too, the carvers had learned to adapt
their designs most perfectly to the nature
of their material; to avoid attempting to
cut large curves, braces and other structural
members out of wood,&mdash;which besides
being wasteful of the material, since enormous
balks were required when large
curves were cut out of the solid wood,
were constructionally weak,&mdash;and to design
their larger pieces with straight lines for
the main frame-work, using curves only on
a smaller scale and in positions where they
were not subjected to much strain.</p>

<p>In design, the work of this period evinces
great vigor and originality. The best
workmen did not repeat predetermined
patterns, but allowed the motives to grow
under their hands, thus endowing even the
smallest pieces with an individuality which
makes the decorative effect as spirited and
varied as it is graceful. The perfection of
architectonic designs in the wood-carving
of this time, was probably due rather to
emulation of the lace-like and elaborate
carving in stone which was being executed
contemporaneously, than the imitation of it.</p>

<p>The modern notion that carved wood
should be left unpainted was quite foreign
to Gothic designers. They preferred even
a simple coating of white or red to the
natural tone of the material, and commonly
the chief members of all the mouldings
were adorned with delicately painted patterns.
Our "restorers" have in most
cases, however, scraped off all that remained
of this brilliant decoration.</p>

<p>The excellent preservation of specimens
of even the most fragile wood-carvings of
this century is due doubtless to the extreme
care with which the workmen selected and
prepared their material. Oak was almost
invariably employed; and it is evident that
not only was it critically selected but that
it was subjected to an elaborate process of
preparation. It was probably left for long
in damp places, sometimes even soaked in
water, after which it was thoroughly dried
in the open air and thereafter occasionally
smoked, for the purpose of hardening the
surface.</p>
